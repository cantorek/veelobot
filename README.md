# veelobot


my www crawler

it's kinda fast, reliable and good

it stores results in blob file

needs

Net::Curl::Easy

Net::Curl::Multi

Compress::LZ4



libcurl
c-ares

without c-ares it will be slow
async dns is what we want



sometimes is segfaults/bus error with high number of curl handles, not sure why
